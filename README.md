## Google Colab Space
I wrote the following tiny scripts to be ran in a python notebooks:

- [Combine PDF Notebook](#combine-pdf-notebook)
- [Base64 Image Encoder](#base64-image-encoder)

### [Combine PDF Notebook](./combinepdf.ipynb)
You can use this notebook to merge multiple PDF files into a single document.

### [Base64 Image Encoder](base64_encoder.ipynb)
You can use this notebook to encode multiple images to Base64 and then export that to a CSV.
